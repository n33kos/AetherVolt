Welcome heroes! Here is an introduction to the world of Aetheria to help you create your characters.

**World Information**
*   Magic is relatively common in Aetheria but little is understood about how it works and it is very exhausting to use.
*   There is only one kind of magic, “grav magic” in which magic users are able to modify gravity in various ways including adjusting gravitational direction, mass, and behavior.
*   Aetheria is a broken world, the continents float in the sky and there are no regular oceans, It is generally accepted that eons of gravity magic are the cause of the irregular gravity.
*   Aetheria is a large, mostly temperate world with a long history in which multiple empires have risen and crumbled.
*   Gravity works very close to normal on the continents but becomes less effective the closer to the planet’s core one travels.
*   The core of the planet seems to absorb light, the close one gets to the core the darker it gets.
*   There are many ruins from a once great society scattered around the world and most of what the races know about how grav magic works has been teased out of the ruins. Most civilizations have historians who study the ruins in hope of restoring incredible technologies.
*   The current technological level for most races is roughly analogous to earth in the 1600s. Grav magic is used to create airships, rifles, guns, locks, and other mechanical devices.
*   Each continent has multiple large cities and many smaller towns scattered about but he majority of the planet is unexplored and holds many mysterious locations and creatures.
*   Money takes the form of coins: Platinum, Gold, Silver, Copper. There are 100 copper to a silver, 100 silver to a gold, and 100 gold to a platinum.
*   There are four sentient races:
    *   **Human (humanfolk)** - Humans are versatile and intelligent. They are perfectly analogous in appearance to humans on earth. Having few natural advantages they use creativity and tool building as their primary means of survival. Humans usually build civilizations along coastlines to make trade easier between islands and continents and were the first race to develop ships.
    *   **Avian (birdfolk) **- Bird folk are a humanoid bird race. They are usually a bit smaller and lighter than humans and come in as many colors and varieties as bird species on earth. Avians have sharp talons, hands, and wings connected to (and extending past) their arms which allow them to fly. Avians usually build civilizations in high mountains or other mainland areas
    *   **Crustacean (crabfolk)** - Crab folk are humanoid crabs grown to a massive size. They are usually larger than humans with hard shells and sometimes spikes. Their shells are usually brown, red, blue, or green in color but there are many rare subgroups which vary widely in color. They have two large and powerful claws at the end of their primary arms, and two sets of small thin claws which they usually keep pressed close against their lower abdomen. They are unable to wield regular weapons with their large claws but the small claws are much more dexterous and can fire weapons or work on delicate tools when needed. Crustaceans usually build civilizations underground and tend to live in smaller groups than the other races.
    *   **Chiropteran (batfolk)** - Batfolk are humanoid bats and come in the same sort of variety in appearance as bats do on earth. Some have flat squashed noses while others have long fox-like snouts. They usually have very large ears, glowing eyes, and can use echolocation to see in complete darkness. Batfolk have the ability to fly but have a harder time flying at higher altitude (and higher gravity) than avians do. Batfolk are not often seen on the surface. They build civilizations on the underside of continents where the gravity is lighter.
*   Batfolk are rarely seen on the surface but have been making appearances more frequently of late.
*   All races have the ability to speak and most know common (human language) but each has its own language. Birdfolk have a musical language and use many chirps and whistles in speech. Crabfolk can speak but have difficulty making the same sounds so they have a thicks accent. Crabfolk language is mostly gestural. Batfolk language is inaudible to most creatures as it is spoken at ultra high frequencies. They tend to have high pitched voices.

**Gravity / Physics / Tales**



*   There are countless floating islands both large and small but the continents and islands seem to stay around the same height.
*   Rivers and streams fall directly off the continent and eventually become a mist which evaporates on its way down to the core. Evaporated water creates clouds which precipitate and start the cycle again.
*   There are tales of those who attempted to travel down into the planet core using gravity magic. Few returned.
*   One great birdfolk captain “Osmere” reported that gravity got gradually weaker the lower they went. Several score miles down they were unable to travel down any farther. The grav magicians aboard reported that their magic seemed to be negated and they were only able to return to the surface by tow rope from vessels at higher altitude. Osmere himself flew even lower and reported eventually running into a debris cloud but the darkness made it impossible to determine what the debris was comprised of. Osmere grabbed a piece and brought it back to the ship to find that it was the skull of an unrecognizable creature.

**Starting City**



*   All players will start in the human city **Solengarde**. A bustling port town on the island **Thesmir**. **Solengarde** acts as the southern jumping off point from the continent **Toran **so it is heavily populated and has all manner of services and goods. Despite being a human town it houses a solid mix of all races and considers itself a separately governed entity from rest of the continent.
*   All players several weeks before the game begins had strange dreams of creatures made of mist. Once these began they all noticed a light glowing vertical streak on their foreheads. This is referred to as being “touched” or “light touched” and is viewed by some as a blessing and others as a curse. Light touched are rare and only a few dozen in the whole city have been identified.
*   Light touched have regular dreams or visions of locations and ruins they have never seen before.
*   The light touched tend to be blessed with exceptional skill in one way or another and this has started to cause a stir amongst those who believe they are demon touched.
*   When the game starts, tension has been rising and there have been some violent acts committed against light touched by those with prejudice. Many light touched have become nervous about letting their mark show in public.
*   The academy has put out a call to light touched, providing sanction for those who are seeking safety from the public reaction.

**Magic**





*   Everyone has the ability to do grav magic but it takes either a ton of practice or a natural affinity for it to actually use it effectively. Most normal people can interact with objects made using grav principles but rarely devote their lives to getting good at it.
*   It’s common to learn from an apprenticeship or guild if one wants to excel at it. It’s a skill similar to programming or music. Anyone could do it given enough determination but it’s complex and devoting a life to it means you don’t have much time to work for money u less you find a profession doing it
*   The reason it’s complex is that part of learning how to use it requires research into the language and ruins of the old civilizations. People in the world are still uncovering secrets from those societies and have only reached a tiny fraction of the power an arcanist could have

**Politics**



*   The Toran continent is a **monarchic** country governed by an **avian** bloodline. As the continent is very large there are lords and nobles who oversee smaller towns and cities.
*   About 10 years prior to the game starting point, there was a **civil war** between occupants of the south-eastern wing of Toran and the rest of the continent. Eventually the resistance conceded and rejoined the monarchy
*   There are many races on the continent but there are **only Avian nobility. **This is part of the reason for the uprising. It is common for members of the guard to be of any race but it’s easier to rank up if you are avian because there is always a bias toward the birdfolk in politics.
*   The Toran queen is named **Freska Ellindar**, her husband the king died during the war, a point which still causes contention between the southeasterners and those loyal to the throne
*   Because the continent is so large, many of the south-easterners still consider themselves to be independent of royal control. All the way down in Thesmir, there is very limited royal representation. The lord of Thesmir, **Raffian Kliikor,** is an avian loyal to the throne in responsibility but it is known that he was once part of the resistance so the people support him as an extension of their own interest.
*   The lord tends to bow to the whims of the trade guild because without the free flow of resources he would have a more difficult time paying dues to the queen.
*   There is a guard who acts upon the orders of the Baron, the ranks from highest to lowest are Captain, Knights (squad leaders for groups of soldiers), and Soldiers.

**The Luminous Academy**



*   There is a strong academic presence in Thesmir, “The Luminous Academy” is established right on the coast. It is where magicians study the old races and magics.
*   The academy was established because there is a large floating ruin nestled in the cove of the city which makes it easy to study without traveling far.
*   The academy often charters expeditions to various locations for study and is known to pay its workers very fairly for their efforts.
*   The academy’s headmaster is **Dennimar Roch,** a very old human who is known to be one of the most powerful arcanists in the country.
*   The academy is expensive to attend, but has plenty of income due to it being the place where many new technologies are developed and manufactured.

**The Royal Council**



*   The royal counsel consists of the Lord (**Raffian Kliikor**), the headmaster **(Dennimar Roch)**, the captain of the guard **(Kaith Skeen)**, the head priest of the church **(Serna Chan)**, and the commissioner of the trade guild **(Taar Humbelly)**.

**The Church of the Morning**



*   The church of the morning is the most common religion on the continent, it’s centered around writings in the book of morning. The book of morning is an old document translated from archaic avian and it holds prophecies of a time when the light will come but warns that in the light there are shadows.
*   The majority of the believers in the church consider the light touched to be signs of the darkness coming. Those true believers believe that the light touched are a defense against the darkness, but there are few who interpret the writings this way.
*   The religion of the church of the morning is centered around the concept of opportunity, they believe that it the will of the Gods that all beings seize opportunities presented to them. Of course some opportunities will clearly lead to consequences so there is a lot of varied interpretation on which deities have which motivations.
*   Many nonbelievers see proponents of the church of the morning as hedonists but those in the church do not see it that way, the way they see it the world is unpredictable and it is the right of each being that it takes pleasure in the moment and takes advantage of opportunities because moments are fleeting.


**The Forgotten Ones**

The forgotten ones are our large-scale antagonists. The forgotten ones are an ancient race of castoffs thousands of years old who were lost to the core of the earth. They have civilizations in the underdark and save unwary souls who fall to their doom. They are all immortal unless their soul gems are broken. Once your soul is trapped in a gem your body dies. The forgotten ones use a ritual to bind the gems to a skull which creates for them a connection to the living realm. This connection allows them to use grav magic in the physical realm. Their bodies have long since decayed but many still carry their original form as part of their new body. Most have been alive so long that the body is a smokelike collection of particles held together with grav magic. To take a more corporeal form they magic up the castoff bones of creatures to make new bodies.

They are beings of animated smoke who use the bones of other creatures as skeletons. The forgotten ones are comprised of wizards who fell to the depths and never returned. In order to stay alive they separated their souls into a soul gem.

All forgotten ones have soul gems bound to a bone somewhere on their bodies. This is where their souls live. If touched the soul can decide to cause cause 1d6 psychic damage if you fail a CONST saving throw of 14.

The forgotten ones are trying to recover their great ancestors. Gems containing numerous souls together who have lost their bodies (The gem the heroes find in episode 1 is a great ancestor). They are trying to recover the ancestors from the surface to free them of the slavery of being used as tools and to power their return to corporeal form (Giant ass shadow demons). The ancestors were lost years ago by adventurers who tried to use their powers to return to the surface and fulfill the prophecies.

Forgotten one language:



*   **light touched:** “sin faroth” or “The hunters” as they have prophecies of the light touched coming to strike them from the world.
*   **The great ancestors:** “sin ack amemnon”
*   **The forgotten:** “sin ka’aal”
*   **The breaking:** “sin filare”
*   (Just use an arabic translator them ness up the words a bit.)

They have pretty much the same stats as a “shadow demon” but I expect that to change with the story.

The forgotten aren’t strictly evil but they tend toward necromancy because for them, death and decay are all their world is made of. They aren’t above animating other materials on the surface however. They are a proud dark-elf like race with beautiful culture despite their horrifying appearance. Their aggression toward the surface dwellers is largely focused around the great ancestors and getting them back. They are intelligent and thoughtful but will recover their ancestors at any cost.

The forgotten are aggressive or fearful toward the hunters because the prophecies told that the light touched would hunt down the ancestors and that it would be the end of the darkness which they interpret as the end of their race. In truth the long term story arc is to get the heroes to save the ancestors and collaborate with the forgotten ones to restore the world to its former state before the breaking. There must at some point be a forgotten one who chooses to speak with them instead of fighting
